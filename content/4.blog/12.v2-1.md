## Implementation Examples

### Docker GPU Acceleration Configuration

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose configuration with GPU support
version: '3.8'
services:
  ml-training:
    image: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 2
              capabilities: [gpu]
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility
    volumes:
      - ./training:/workspace/training
    command: python /workspace/training/train.py
```

### Content Trust 2.0 Implementation

```bash
# Enable Docker Content Trust with Notary v2
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_SERVER=https://notary.example.com

# Sign and push an image with hardware key
docker trust key generate prod-key
docker trust signer add --key prod-key.pub prod-signer registry.example.com/app

# Push signed image
docker push registry.example.com/app:v1.0.0

# Verify signature
docker trust inspect registry.example.com/app:v1.0.0
```

### Kubernetes Topology Aware Routing

```yaml
# Example EndpointSlice with topology hints
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: web-app
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/service-name: web-app
addressType: IPv4
ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
endpoints:
  - addresses: ["10.0.1.1"]
    conditions:
      ready: true
    topology:
      kubernetes.io/zone: us-east-1a
      kubernetes.io/hostname: node-1
    hints:
      forZones:
        - name: us-east-1a
  - addresses: ["10.0.2.1"]
    conditions:
      ready: true
    topology:
      kubernetes.io/zone: us-east-1b
      kubernetes.io/hostname: node-2
