# From Docker to Kubernetes v2.4.0 Release

We're thrilled to announce our **From Docker to Kubernetes v2.4.0** release! This version introduces four powerful topics—two in Docker and two in Kubernetes—focusing on advanced security, resource management, and cluster operations.

## Advanced Docker Capabilities 🐳

Our v2.4.0 release brings sophisticated Docker features focused on security and resource optimization:

::steps
### Docker Secrets Management
Our comprehensive guide to secure secrets handling covers:
- Secure storage and distribution of sensitive data
- Integration with external secret stores
- Dynamic secrets rotation
- Access control and audit logging
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secrets lifecycle management

### Docker Resource Management
Master advanced resource control with:
- CPU and memory allocation strategies
- Storage driver optimization
- Network resource controls
- Resource monitoring and alerting
- Performance tuning guidelines
- Resource quota enforcement
::

## Kubernetes Advanced Features 🚢

The Kubernetes section expands with two powerful operational capabilities:

::steps
### Kubernetes Resource Requests & Limits
Implement sophisticated resource management with:
- Resource quota planning
- Limit range configurations
- Quality of Service (QoS) classes
- Resource optimization strategies
- Vertical and horizontal scaling
- Performance monitoring tools

### Kubernetes Cluster API
Deploy and manage clusters at scale with:
- Declarative cluster management
- Multi-cloud provisioning
- Cluster lifecycle automation
- Infrastructure abstraction
- Provider integration patterns
- Cluster upgrades and maintenance

## Implementation Examples

### Docker Secrets Management

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose with secrets
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    secrets:
      - db_password
      - api_key
    environment:
      - DB_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db_password
      - API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/api_key
    configs:
      - source: app_config
        target: /app/config.yml

secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
    name: prod_db_password_v1
  api_key:
    file: ./secrets/api_key.txt

configs:
  app_config:
    file: ./config/app.yml
```

### Resource Management Configuration

```yaml
# Example resource management setup
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          cpus: '1'
          memory: 1G
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        max_attempts: 3
    blkio_config:
      weight: 300
      device_read_bps:
        - path: /dev/sda
          rate: '100MB'
    ulimits:
      nproc: 65535
      nofile:
        soft: 20000
        hard: 40000
```

### Kubernetes Resource Configuration

```yaml
# Example resource requests and limits
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: team-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "20"
    requests.memory: 100Gi
    limits.cpu: "40"
    limits.memory: 200Gi
    requests.storage: 500Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: default-limits
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
