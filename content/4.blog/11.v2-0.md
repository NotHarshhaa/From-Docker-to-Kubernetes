# From Docker to Kubernetes v2.0.0 Release

We're thrilled to announce our milestone **From Docker to Kubernetes v2.0.0** release! This major version update introduces four comprehensive new topics—two in Docker and two in Kubernetes—focusing on advanced security patterns, orchestration capabilities, API extension, and network security.

## Security-Focused Docker Enhancements 🐳

Our v2.0.0 release brings powerful Docker capabilities focused on security and advanced orchestration:

::steps
### Docker Rootless Mode
Our comprehensive guide to running Docker without root privileges covers:
- Rootless architecture and security model fundamentals
- Detailed installation and configuration procedures
- Day-to-day operations without root privileges
- Networking, storage, and resource management in rootless mode
- Production deployment strategies and security hardening
- Troubleshooting common issues and limitations

### Docker Compose V2 Advanced Features
Master the latest capabilities in Docker Compose V2 with:
- CLI plugin integration and Compose specification enhancements
- Advanced service, network, and volume configuration patterns
- Sophisticated environment management and variable substitution
- Service extension, scaling, and orchestration techniques
- Performance optimization for production environments
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and multi-environment strategies
::

## Kubernetes Extension and Security 🚢

The Kubernetes section expands with two powerful operational topics:

::steps
### Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
Extend Kubernetes with custom APIs through:
- CRD architecture and implementation fundamentals
- Schema definition with advanced validation rules
- Versioning strategies and conversion webhooks
- Status management and subresource configuration
- Controller and operator implementation patterns
- Testing, validation, and best practices for production

### Kubernetes Network Policies
Implement zero-trust networking in Kubernetes with:
- Network Policy fundamentals and selector patterns
- Common policy patterns for security and isolation
- Advanced features for granular traffic control
- Testing and validation of policy effectiveness
- Management at scale with policy-as-code approaches
- Compliance patterns for PCI DSS and zero-trust architectures

## Implementation Examples

### Docker Rootless Mode Configuration

```bash
# Install Docker in rootless mode
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/rootless | sh

# Configure environment variables
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock

# Set up systemd user service
systemctl --user enable docker
systemctl --user start docker
loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)

# Verify rootless installation
docker info | grep -E "Context|Username"
```

### Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition

```yaml
# Example CRD for application deployments
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: applications.platform.example.com
spec:
  group: platform.example.com
  names:
    kind: Application
    plural: applications
    singular: application
    shortNames:
      - app
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                version:
                  type: string
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                  minimum: 1
                resources:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    tier:
                      type: string
                      enum: [small, medium, large]
              required: [version, replicas]
      subresources:
        status: {}
```

### Network Policy Implementation

```yaml
# Zero-trust network foundation
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Applies to all pods
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
---
# Allow specific application communication
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-communication
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  policyTypes:

## Industry Insights

Our v2.0.0 content incorporates feedback from organizations already implementing these patterns:

> "The Docker Rootless Mode guide enabled us to implement a significant security enhancement across our development and production environments. We've eliminated an entire class of container escape vulnerabilities while maintaining the developer experience our teams rely on."
> 
> — *Security Architect at a financial services organization*

> "Using the Custom Resource Definitions patterns, we built a self-service platform that abstracts away Kubernetes complexity for our development teams. What used to take weeks of learning and coordination now happens through simple, declarative resources that enforce our best practices automatically."
> 
> — *Platform Engineering Lead at a SaaS provider*

> "The Network Policies implementation guide gave us a blueprint for achieving our zero-trust networking objectives in Kubernetes. We were able to demonstrate SOC 2 compliance with much less effort while actually improving our security posture."
> 
> — *Cloud Security Engineer at a healthcare technology company*
