# From Docker to Kubernetes v2.3.0 Release

We're thrilled to announce our **From Docker to Kubernetes v2.3.0** release! This version introduces four powerful topics—two in Docker and two in Kubernetes—focusing on advanced networking, service discovery, observability, and security controls.

## Advanced Docker Capabilities 🐳

Our v2.3.0 release brings sophisticated Docker features focused on networking and monitoring:

::steps
### Docker Service Discovery DNS
Our comprehensive guide to service discovery and DNS management covers:
- DNS-based service discovery patterns
- Container name resolution strategies
- Custom DNS configurations
- Network alias management
- Service registration and health checks
- Cross-network service discovery

### Docker Observability Platforms
Master comprehensive monitoring and observability with:
- Multi-dimensional metrics collection
- Distributed tracing implementation
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance monitoring tools
- Custom metrics and exporters
- Real-time alerting systems
::

## Kubernetes Advanced Features 🚢

The Kubernetes section expands with two powerful operational capabilities:

::steps
### Kubernetes Network Policies
Implement sophisticated network security with:
- Fine-grained traffic control
- Multi-tier network segmentation
- Egress and ingress rules
- Policy-based microsegmentation
- Cross-namespace communication
- Zero-trust networking patterns

### Kubernetes Admission Controllers
Deploy advanced security controls with:
- Custom admission webhooks
- Policy enforcement patterns
- Resource validation rules
- Security context verification
- Image policy control
- Dynamic admission control
::

## Implementation Examples

### Docker Service Discovery Configuration

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose with service discovery
version: '3.8'
services:
  service-a:
    image: service-a:latest
    networks:
      - backend
    dns_search:
      - service.local
    labels:
      - "discovery.service=true"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  service-b:
    image: service-b:latest
    networks:
      - backend
    dns:
      - 10.0.0.10
    depends_on:
      service-a:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      - SERVICE_A_HOST=service-a.service.local

networks:
  backend:
    driver: overlay
    name: service-network
```

### Observability Platform Setup

```yaml
# Example observability configuration
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      - "prometheus.scrape=true"
      - "prometheus.port=8080"
    logging:
      driver: "fluentd"
      options:
        fluentd-address: "localhost:24224"
        tag: "app.{{.Name}}"
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.50'
          memory: 512M
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317
      - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=myapp
```

### Kubernetes Network Policy

```yaml
# Example network policy configuration
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: secure-microservices
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend-api
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              environment: production
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: database
      ports:
