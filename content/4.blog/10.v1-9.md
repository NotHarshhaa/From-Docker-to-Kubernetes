# From Docker to Kubernetes v1.9.0 Release

We're excited to announce the release of **From Docker to Kubernetes v1.9.0**! This major update introduces six comprehensive new topics—three in Docker and three in Kubernetes—focusing on observability, service discovery, secrets management, admission control, resource optimization, and declarative cluster management.

## Advanced Docker Observability & Service Management 🐳

Our v1.9.0 release brings powerful Docker capabilities focused on comprehensive observability, service discovery, and secrets management:

::steps
### Docker Observability Platforms
Our comprehensive guide to implementing observability solutions in Docker environments covers:
- Three pillars approach integrating metrics, logs, and traces
- Implementing Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK, and OpenTelemetry
- Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) and error budget tracking
- Real-time alerting and incident response workflows
- Performance analysis and optimization techniques
- AI-powered observability and eBPF for deep visibility

### Docker Service Discovery & DNS
Master container networking and service location with:
- Core service discovery patterns and architecture models
- Docker DNS resolution and network configuration strategies
- Multi-host networking with Docker Swarm and overlay networks
- External service discovery tools like Consul, etcd, and CoreDNS
- Health checking and circuit breaking for resilient systems
- Security considerations for service discovery implementations

### Docker Secrets Management
Implement robust secrets handling in containerized environments:
- Docker native secrets with Swarm and Compose integration
- External secrets management with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Azure Key Vault
- BuildKit secret mounting for secure image building
- Runtime secrets injection patterns and environment variable management
- Secret rotation, versioning, and auditing strategies
- Secure CI/CD integration for automated deployments
::

## Advanced Kubernetes Governance & Infrastructure 🚢

The Kubernetes section expands with three powerful operational topics:

::steps
### Kubernetes Admission Controllers
Implement sophisticated policy enforcement and governance:
- Admission controller architecture and request processing flow
- Built-in controllers like ResourceQuota, LimitRanger, and PodSecurity
- Dynamic admission webhooks for custom validation and mutation
- Policy frameworks with OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno
- Advanced configuration for failure policies and reinvocation
- Security and performance optimization for production deployments

### Kubernetes Resource Requests & Limits
Master compute resource allocation and optimization:
- Resource fundamentals covering CPU, memory, and extended resources
- QoS classes and pod priority for predictable resource management
- Setting appropriate requests and limits with ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges
- Monitoring, vertical autoscaling, and resource optimization strategies
- Advanced CPU and memory management policies
- Resource-based autoscaling and scheduling techniques

### Kubernetes Cluster API
Implement declarative infrastructure management for clusters:
- Cluster API architecture and resource model
- Working with infrastructure providers for AWS, Azure, vSphere, and more
- Cluster lifecycle operations including scaling and upgrading
- Advanced patterns with MachineHealthChecks and ClusterClass
- GitOps integration for version-controlled cluster management
- Best practices for security, operations, and infrastructure design
