## Implementation Examples

### Edge Computing Container Configuration

```yaml
# Docker Compose configuration for edge deployment
version: '3.8'

services:
  edge-app:
    image: my-edge-app:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.50'
          memory: 64M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        max_attempts: 3
    volumes:
      - /data:/data:ro
    configs:
      - source: edge_config
        target: /config/config.yaml
    environment:
      - OFFLINE_MODE=enabled
      - SYNC_INTERVAL=300
      - MAX_BUFFER_SIZE=500MB

configs:
  edge_config:
    file: ./config.yaml
```

### Database Containerization Example

```yaml
# High-availability PostgreSQL configuration
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres_primary:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    volumes:
      - postgres_primary_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./primary.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:ro
    command: postgres -c 'config_file=/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf'
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  postgres_standby:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
