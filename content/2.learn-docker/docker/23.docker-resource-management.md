## Introduction to Docker Resource Management

Docker provides powerful capabilities for managing and limiting container resources. Proper resource management is crucial for:
- Ensuring application performance
- Preventing resource starvation
- Optimizing resource utilization
- Managing costs in cloud environments
- Maintaining system stability

Without effective resource constraints, containers can consume excessive resources, causing degraded performance or even outages across your host system. Docker's resource management features allow you to implement fine-grained control over how containers use system resources, enabling predictable performance and better multi-tenant environments.

### Resource Types in Docker

Docker allows you to control several key resource types:

1. **CPU**: Limit processing power allocation and scheduling priority
2. **Memory**: Control RAM usage and behavior when limits are reached
3. **Storage**: Manage disk I/O rates and space consumption
4. **Network**: Regulate bandwidth usage and connection limitations

Understanding how these resources interact and how Docker manages them is fundamental to building robust containerized applications.

## CPU Management

### CPU Shares and Limits

Docker allows you to control CPU usage through several mechanisms:

```bash
# Limit CPU shares (relative weight)
docker run --cpu-shares=512 nginx

# Limit CPU cores
docker run --cpus=2 nginx

# Specify specific CPU cores
docker run --cpuset-cpus="0,2" nginx
```

Each of these approaches serves different use cases and provides different guarantees about CPU utilization.

### CPU Configuration Options

::alert{type="info"}
1. **CPU Shares (--cpu-shares)**
   - Default value: 1024
   - Relative weight to other containers
   - Only applies when CPU is contested
   - Flexible and dynamic allocation
   - Does not guarantee CPU time
   - Good for development environments
   - Works best with similar workloads
   - Scales with available CPUs
   - Simple to implement
   - Non-disruptive to running containers

2. **CPU Quota (--cpu-quota)**
   - Absolute CPU time limit
   - Measured in microseconds
   - Hard limit on CPU usage
   - Precise control over CPU time
   - Works with CPU period setting
   - Good for enforcing SLAs
   - Prevents CPU monopolization
   - Can cause throttling if set too low
   - More complex to calculate correctly
   - May require application tuning

3. **CPU Period (--cpu-period)**
   - Length of CPU scheduling period
   - Default: 100000 microseconds
   - Works with CPU quota
   - Fine-grained CPU control
   - Lower values mean more frequent scheduling
   - Can impact latency-sensitive workloads
   - Requires understanding of Linux CFS
   - Advanced configuration option
   - Best used with detailed monitoring
   - May require iterative tuning
::

### CPU Management Deep Dive

CPU management in Docker leverages Linux's Control Groups (cgroups) to enforce limits on container resource usage. Understanding the underlying mechanisms helps with proper configuration:

1. **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**
   - Linux's default CPU scheduler
   - Allocates CPU time based on weights
   - Docker CPU shares map directly to CFS weights
   - Operates within scheduling periods

2. **Real-Time Scheduling**
   - For latency-sensitive applications
   - Uses `--cpu-rt-runtime` and `--cpu-rt-period`
   - Requires special kernel configuration
   - Provides guaranteed CPU time

3. **CPU Pinning and NUMA Awareness**
   ```bash
   # Pin to specific CPUs
   docker run --cpuset-cpus="0,1" nginx
   
   # Pin to specific NUMA nodes
   docker run --cpuset-mems="0" nginx
   ```
   - Important for cache coherency
   - Critical for memory-intensive applications
   - Can dramatically improve performance
   - Requires understanding of hardware topology

4. **CPU Throttling Behavior**
   - Occurs when container exceeds CPU limits
   - Can cause performance degradation
   - Affects application responsiveness
   - Important to monitor and tune
   - May require application adaptation

## Memory Management

### Memory Limits and Reservations

Control container memory usage:

```bash
# Set memory limit
docker run -m 512m nginx

# Set memory reservation
docker run --memory-reservation 256m nginx

# Set swap limit
docker run --memory-swap 1g nginx
```

Memory is often the most critical resource to manage, as exceeding memory limits can lead to container termination.

### Memory Configuration Parameters

::steps

### Memory Reservation (--memory-reservation)
- Soft limit/minimum guarantee
- Flexible allocation
- Helps with scheduling
- No runtime enforcement
- Guides kernel memory reclamation
- Lower priority than hard limits

2. **Memory Swappiness**
   ```bash
   # Set memory swappiness
   docker run --memory-swappiness=60 nginx
   ```
   - Controls kernel's tendency to swap
   - Range from 0 (avoid swap) to 100 (aggressive swap)
   - Impacts performance predictability
   - Can significantly affect latency
   - Depends on workload characteristics

3. **Kernel Memory Limits**
   ```bash
   # Set kernel memory limit
   docker run --kernel-memory=50m nginx
   ```
   - Limits kernel memory used by container
   - Includes TCP buffers, socket memory
   - Important for network-intensive workloads
   - Prevents kernel memory exhaustion
   - More restrictive than user memory limits

4. **Memory Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # View container memory usage
   docker stats container_id
   
   # Get detailed memory breakdown
   docker exec container_id cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.stat
   ```
   - Essential for proper limit setting
   - Helps identify memory leaks

   ```bash
   # Set block I/O weight
   docker run --blkio-weight 500 nginx
   
   # Set device-specific weight
   docker run --blkio-weight-device /dev/sda:500 nginx
   ```
   - Valid weight range: 10-1000
   - Default weight: 500
   - Relative weighting system
   - Only applies during contention
   - Similar concept to CPU shares
   - Does not guarantee I/O throughput
   - Requires blkio cgroup support
