## Docker Networking

Docker networking enables containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Understanding networking is crucial for building distributed applications.

At its core, Docker networking is built on Linux networking capabilities, providing a flexible and powerful system for connecting containers. Docker uses a pluggable architecture that supports various network drivers to accommodate different use cases, from simple single-host applications to complex multi-host distributed systems.

The networking subsystem in Docker is designed to be:
- Isolated: Containers have their own network namespace
- Configurable: Multiple network types for different requirements
- Performant: Optimized for container-to-container communication
- Secure: Support for network segmentation and access controls
- Extensible: Pluggable architecture for custom networking solutions

## Network Types

::steps
### Bridge Network
- Default network type (`bridge` driver)
- Used when containers need to communicate on the same Docker host
- Provides network isolation between containers
- Containers can communicate using container names as DNS
- Creates a virtual bridge interface on the host (typically `docker0`)
- Assigns containers to a private subnet (typically 172.17.0.0/16)
- Default bridge network doesn't provide automatic DNS resolution
- Custom bridge networks support DNS resolution by container name
- Each container gets its own IP address within the subnet

### Host Network
- Removes network isolation between container and host (`host` driver)
- Container uses host's network directly (shares host's network namespace)
- Better performance but less secure (no network isolation)
- Useful for specific use cases requiring direct host network access
- No port mapping needed as container ports are exposed directly on host
- Potential port conflicts with host services or other containers
- Limited to services running on a single host
- Not compatible with Docker Swarm mode services

### Overlay Network
- Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts
- Used in Docker Swarm mode (`overlay` driver)
- Provides multi-host networking out of the box
- Supports container-to-container encryption
- Uses VXLAN encapsulation for traffic between hosts
- Automatically manages IP allocation across the cluster
- Enables service discovery across the entire swarm
- Integrates with swarm load balancing for distributed services
- Supports both swarm services and standalone containers

### Macvlan Network
- Assigns MAC address to containers (`macvlan` driver)
- Containers appear as physical devices on network
- Useful for legacy applications
- Provides better network performance
- Gives each container a unique MAC and IP address on the physical network
- Requires promiscuous mode support on host network interface
- Can connect containers directly to existing VLANs
- May require configuration of physical network equipment
- Good for applications that expect to be directly connected to physical network

### None Network
- Container has no network connectivity (`none` driver)
- Complete network isolation
- Container cannot communicate with external networks or other containers
- Useful for batch processing jobs where network access is not required
- Maximum security isolation from network perspective
- Can still use IPC or volume sharing for communication if needed

### IPvlan Network
- Alternative to macvlan that doesn't require promiscuous mode
- Shares MAC address with host but assigns unique IP addresses to containers
- Supports L2 and L3 modes for different routing requirements
- Good for environments where promiscuous mode is restricted
- Often more efficient for large-scale deployments

## Basic Networking Commands

```bash
# List networks
docker network ls

# List networks with more details
docker network ls --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Name}}\t{{.Driver}}\t{{.Scope}}"

# Create a network
docker network create my-network

# Create a network with specific driver
docker network create --driver overlay my-swarm-network

# Connect container to network
docker network connect my-network container-name

# Connect with static IP address
docker network connect --ip 172.18.0.10 my-network container-name

# Disconnect container from network
docker network disconnect my-network container-name

# Inspect network
docker network inspect my-network

# Inspect specific details with format
docker network inspect -f '{{range .Containers}}{{.Name}} {{.IPv4Address}}{{end}}' my-network

# Remove network
docker network rm my-network

# Remove all unused networks
docker network prune

# Filter networks by criteria
docker network ls --filter driver=bridge

# Create a container with a specific network
docker run --network=my-network -d nginx
```

These commands can be combined with other Docker commands and options to create sophisticated networking configurations for your containerized applications.

## Network Configuration Examples

### Creating a User-Defined Network

```bash
# Create a bridge network with custom subnet
docker network create --driver bridge \
  --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 \
  --gateway=172.18.0.1 \
  my-custom-network

# Create a network with IP address range
docker network create --driver bridge \
  --subnet=172.20.0.0/16 \
  --ip-range=172.20.5.0/24 \
  --gateway=172.20.0.1 \
  my-range-network

# Create an overlay network with encryption
docker network create --driver overlay \
  --opt encrypted=true \
  --attachable \
  secure-overlay-network

# Create a macvlan network
docker network create --driver macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 \
  macvlan-network
```

### Connecting Containers

```bash
# Start container with network
docker run -d --network my-network --name container1 nginx

# Start another container in same network
docker run -d --network my-network --name container2 nginx

# Connect running container to additional network
docker network connect my-second-network container1

# Create container with static IP
docker run -d --network my-network --ip 172.18.0.10 --name fixed-ip-container nginx

# Connect container to multiple networks during creation
docker run -d --network my-network --network my-second-network --name multi-network-container nginx

# Test communication between containers
docker exec container1 ping container2

# Inspect container's network settings
docker inspect --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' container1
```

### Docker Compose Networking

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example with custom networks
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      - frontend
  api:
    image: my-api:latest
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true  # No internet access for enhanced security
```

## Port Mapping

::alert{type="info"}
Port mapping allows access to container services from the host:

```bash
# Map container port 80 to host port 8080
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

# Map multiple ports
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 443:443 nginx

# Map to random host port
docker run -P nginx

# Map to specific interface on host
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx

# Map UDP ports
docker run -p 53:53/udp dns-server

# Map both TCP and UDP
docker run -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp dns-server

# View mapped ports for a container
docker port container-name
```

Port mapping works by configuring iptables rules on the host that redirect traffic from the host's port to the container's port. This enables:
- External access to container services
- Service availability on well-known ports
- Load balancing across multiple containers
- Security through controlled exposure

Note that port mappings only apply to bridge networks, not to containers using host networking mode (which already expose all ports directly).
::

## DNS and Service Discovery

Docker provides automatic DNS resolution between containers in the same network:

- Containers can refer to each other by name
- Built-in DNS server at 127.0.0.11
- Automatic service discovery in user-defined networks

### How Docker DNS Works

1. **Container DNS Configuration**: Docker automatically configures each container's `/etc/resolv.conf` to use the Docker DNS server:
   ```
   nameserver 127.0.0.11
   options ndots:0
   ```

2. **Name Resolution Process**:
   - Container requests are sent to Docker's embedded DNS server
   - The DNS server maintains records for all containers in the same network
   - If the name matches a container, it returns the container's IP address
   - Otherwise, it forwards the request to the external DNS servers specified in the host's `/etc/resolv.conf`

3. **Network Scope**: DNS resolution only works between containers on the same user-defined network; the default bridge network does not support this feature

### Service Discovery in Swarm Mode

In Docker Swarm mode, DNS-based service discovery is enhanced:

- Each service gets a DNS entry in the format `service_name`
- Load balancing happens automatically between service replicas
- Virtual IP (VIP) mode provides a single IP that load balances across all replicas
- DNS Round Robin (DNSRR) mode returns all container IPs for client-side load balancing

```bash
# Example of service discovery in Swarm
docker service create --name db --network app-network postgres
docker service create --name api --network app-network --env DB_HOST=db my-api
```

### Custom DNS Configuration

You can customize container DNS settings:

```bash
# Set custom DNS servers
docker run --dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4 nginx

# Set DNS search domains
docker run --dns-search example.com nginx

# Set DNS options
docker run --dns-opt timeout:3 nginx
```

## Network Security Best Practices

::alert{type="warning"}
1. **Use user-defined networks instead of default bridge**
   - Custom networks provide container name DNS resolution
   - Better isolation between container groups
   - More control over subnet and IP assignment
   - Example: `docker network create --internal db-network` for a database network with no internet access

2. **Limit container network access**
   - Use `--internal` flag to create networks without external connectivity
   - Restrict exposed ports to only what's necessary
   - Bind to specific interfaces when needed: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx`
   - Implement drop-all iptables policies and add specific rules

3. **Use network segmentation**
   - Create separate networks for different application tiers
   - Place frontend, backend, and database containers in dedicated networks
   - Connect gateway containers to multiple networks to enable controlled communication
   - Example: Three-tier architecture with frontend, backend, and database networks

4. **Enable network encryption in overlay networks**
   - Use `--opt encrypted=true` when creating overlay networks
   - Secures container-to-container communication across hosts
   - Protects sensitive data in transit
   - Consider performance impact (about 10% overhead)

5. **Regularly audit network configurations**
   - Review network resources with `docker network ls` and `docker network inspect`
   - Check container connections with `docker inspect --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' container-name`
   - Monitor network traffic with tools like tcpdump or Wireshark
   - Use logging to track connection attempts

6. **Follow principle of least privilege**
   - Containers should only connect to networks they need
   - Implement application-level authentication even between containers
   - Use read-only file systems when possible
   - Drop unnecessary capabilities: `docker run --cap-drop=NET_ADMIN nginx`

7. **Additional security measures**
   - Consider network plugins with advanced security features
   - Implement network policies (with Kubernetes or custom solutions)
   - Use TLS for all service-to-service communication
   - Deploy a service mesh for advanced security controls in larger deployments

### Common Network Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Troubleshooting Steps |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Container can't reach internet | `ping google.com` fails | Check container DNS, verify host networking, check NAT configuration |
| Containers can't find each other | Name resolution fails | Ensure they're on same network, check service names, inspect DNS configuration |
| Port mapping not working | External connection refused | Verify app is listening on correct interface (0.0.0.0), check port conflicts |
| Overlay network issues | Multi-host communication fails | Verify required ports open (2377, 7946, 4789), check VXLAN configuration |
| Performance problems | High latency, low throughput | Monitor network metrics, check for packet loss, verify driver configuration |
| IP address conflicts | Containers fail to start | Use custom subnets, check overlap with existing networks |
