## Docker Networking

Docker networking enables containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Understanding networking is crucial for building distributed applications.

## Network Types

::steps
### Bridge Network
- Default network type
- Used when containers need to communicate on the same Docker host
- Provides network isolation between containers
- Containers can communicate using container names as DNS

### Host Network
- Removes network isolation between container and host
- Container uses host's network directly
- Better performance but less secure
- Useful for specific use cases requiring direct host network access

### Overlay Network
- Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts
- Used in Docker Swarm mode
- Provides multi-host networking out of the box
- Supports container-to-container encryption

### Macvlan Network
- Assigns MAC address to containers
- Containers appear as physical devices on network
- Useful for legacy applications
- Provides better network performance

## Basic Networking Commands

```bash
# List networks
docker network ls

# Create a network
docker network create my-network

# Connect container to network
docker network connect my-network container-name

# Disconnect container from network
docker network disconnect my-network container-name

# Inspect network
docker network inspect my-network

# Remove network
docker network rm my-network
```

## Network Configuration Examples

### Creating a User-Defined Network

```bash
# Create a bridge network with custom subnet
docker network create --driver bridge \
  --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 \
  --gateway=172.18.0.1 \
  my-custom-network
```

### Connecting Containers

```bash
# Start container with network
docker run -d --network my-network --name container1 nginx

# Start another container in same network
docker run -d --network my-network --name container2 nginx
```

## Port Mapping

::alert{type="info"}
Port mapping allows access to container services from the host:

```bash
# Map container port 80 to host port 8080
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

# Map multiple ports
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 443:443 nginx

# Map to random host port
docker run -P nginx
```

## DNS and Service Discovery

Docker provides automatic DNS resolution between containers in the same network:

- Containers can refer to each other by name
- Built-in DNS server at 127.0.0.11
- Automatic service discovery in user-defined networks

## Network Security Best Practices

::alert{type="warning"}
1. Use user-defined networks instead of default bridge
2. Limit container network access
3. Use network segmentation
4. Enable network encryption in overlay networks
5. Regularly audit network configurations
6. Follow principle of least privilege

## Common Network Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check container networking
docker inspect container-name

# View container logs
docker logs container-name

# Check container network connectivity
docker exec container-name ping other-container

# View network statistics
docker network stats
```
