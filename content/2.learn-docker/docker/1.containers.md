## What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

## Container vs Virtual Machines

Unlike virtual machines, containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. This makes them more lightweight and portable.

## Key Concepts

::steps
### Images
Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They contain:
- Application code
- Runtime environment
- Dependencies
- System tools
- System libraries

### Containers
Containers are running instances of Docker images that can be:
- Started
- Stopped
- Moved
- Deleted

### Registry
A registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry.

## Basic Container Commands

```bash
# Run a container
docker run <image-name>

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop <container-id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container-id>
```

## Best Practices

::alert{type="info"}
1. Use official images when possible
2. Keep containers ephemeral
3. Use .dockerignore files
4. Minimize the number of layers
5. Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
