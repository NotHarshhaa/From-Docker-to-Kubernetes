## Docker in Edge Computing

Docker provides powerful capabilities for edge computing, enabling consistent deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across distributed edge locations. By containerizing edge applications, organizations can standardize deployment processes, simplify updates, optimize resource utilization on constrained devices, and create a seamless workflow between cloud and edge environments. Docker's lightweight nature and robust ecosystem make it particularly well-suited for managing the diverse hardware and connectivity challenges of edge computing.

## Edge Computing Fundamentals

## Edge Device Considerations

```yaml
# Resource constraints for edge devices
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"     # Hard limit - container will be OOM killed if exceeded
    cpu: "500m"         # 500 millicpu = 0.5 CPU cores maximum
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"     # Guaranteed minimum memory allocation
    cpu: "250m"         # 250 millicpu = 0.25 CPU cores guaranteed
    
  # Additional resource constraints often needed on edge devices:
  # ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"    # Limit container filesystem usage
  # nvidia.com/gpu: 1           # For edge AI workloads with GPU
  # hugepages-2Mi: "128Mi"      # For performance-sensitive applications
  
  # These limits ensure containers:
  # 1. Don't overwhelm limited edge hardware
  # 2. Have predictable performance characteristics
  # 3. Can coexist with other workloads on the same device
  # 4. Won't cause system-wide instability if misbehaving
```

## Optimizing Docker for Edge

::steps
### Lightweight Base Images
- Alpine-based images
  - Extremely small footprint (~5MB base size)
  - Based on musl libc and BusyBox
  - Perfect for resource-constrained edge devices

  - Example: `FROM alpine:3.17` creates tiny container base
- Distroless containers
  - Contains only application and runtime dependencies
  - No shell, package manager, or unnecessary utilities
  - Improved security posture by removing potential attack vectors
  - Smaller image size and reduced memory footprint
  - Example: `FROM gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian11` for Java apps
- Minimal dependencies
  - Include only libraries explicitly required by application
  - Avoid development packages and documentation
  - Careful package selection with --no-install-recommends
  - Use dependency analysis tools to identify required components
  - Example: Using Python with `pip install --no-cache-dir --no-deps`
- Custom slim images
  - Purpose-built base images for specific edge use cases
  - Tailored runtime environments for edge workloads
  - Optimized for specific hardware architectures (ARM, RISC-V)
  - Pre-configured with edge-specific optimizations
  - Example: Creating ARM-optimized Python runtime images
- Multi-stage builds
  - Separate build environment from runtime environment
  - Use full compiler toolchain in build stage only
  - Copy only necessary artifacts to minimal runtime image
  - Dramatically reduces final image size
  - Example: Build in golang:1.19 and copy binary to scratch image

### Example Optimized Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for edge applications
FROM golang:1.19-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
# Static compilation with optimizations for edge deployment:
# - CGO_ENABLED=0: Creates statically linked binary without C dependencies
# - GOOS=linux: Targets Linux regardless of build host OS
# - -a: Force rebuilding of packages for consistency
# - -installsuffix cgo: Adds suffix to package directory (when using cgo)
# - -ldflags="-s -w": Strips debugging information to reduce binary size
# - -trimpath: Removes file path references for reproducible builds
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o edge-app .

# Use scratch (empty) image for absolute minimal size
FROM scratch
# Copy CA certificates for secure connections
COPY --from=alpine:latest /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
# Copy only the compiled binary from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/edge-app /
# Set executable as entry point - no shell needed
ENTRYPOINT ["/edge-app"]
# Define health check to monitor application status
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s CMD ["/edge-app", "health"]
# Add metadata about the image

## Docker Security at the Edge

```dockerfile
# Security-focused edge container
FROM alpine:3.17

# Add non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1000 edge && \
    adduser -u 1000 -G edge -s /bin/sh -D edge
# Creating a dedicated non-root user:
# - Reduces privileges in case of application compromise
# - Follows principle of least privilege
# - Adds additional security boundary
# - Proper UID/GID mapping for file permissions

# Install minimal dependencies
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates tzdata && \
    apk --no-cache upgrade
# ca-certificates: Required for secure HTTPS connections
# tzdata: Proper time zone handling for logging and scheduling
# upgrade: Applies latest security patches
# --no-cache: Reduces image size by not storing the APK cache

# Set up application
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=edge:edge ./app /app
# Setting proper ownership:
# - Ensures application can access its files
# - Prevents permission issues at runtime
# - Maintains principle of least privilege

# Security hardening
RUN chmod -R 550 /app && \
    chmod -R 770 /app/data && \
    rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && \
    find /app -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod 550 {} \;
# 550 permission: Read and execute but not write
# 770 for data: Application needs write access to data directory
# Cleanup reduces attack surface
# Explicit permission for shell scripts

# Drop capabilities
USER edge
# Switching to non-root user before execution
# Prevents privilege escalation attacks
# Reduces impact of potential security vulnerabilities

# Add security labels

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.description="Secure edge application"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.created="2023-08-01T00:00:00Z"

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]

# Healthcheck
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget -q -O - http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
# Regular health monitoring:
# - Detects application failures quickly
# - Enables automatic container restarts when needed
# - Provides status information to orchestration systems
# - start-period allows application initialization time
# - retries prevents premature failure declaration
