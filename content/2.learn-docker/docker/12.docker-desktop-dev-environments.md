## Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop provides an easy-to-use, integrated environment for building, sharing, and running containerized applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It bundles the Docker engine, CLI client, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and other essential tools into a single application with a graphical user interface, making container development accessible to developers of all experience levels.

## Getting Started with Docker Desktop

::steps
### Installation
- **Platform-specific installers**: Different installation packages optimized for Windows (with WSL2 integration), macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), and Linux
- **System requirements**: Minimum 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and 20GB disk space; Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise or WSL2 on Home edition; macOS 10.15+ or Apple Silicon
- **Desktop configuration options**: Customizable resources, file sharing, network settings, and Kubernetes configuration
- **Integration with operating system**: Native integration with Windows, macOS, and Linux filesystems, networking, and authentication
- **Extension management**: Built-in marketplace for Docker extensions to enhance functionality and workflow integration

### Key Features
- **Container management UI**: Intuitive graphical interface for starting, stopping, and monitoring containers
- **Image browsing and management**: Visual tools for exploring, pulling, building, and cleaning up container images
- **Docker Hub integration**: Seamless access to public and private repositories with credential management
- **Volume and network management**: Create, configure, and monitor Docker volumes and networks through the UI
- **Integrated Kubernetes**: Single-node Kubernetes cluster built-in, allowing easy switching between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes
- **Dashboard analytics**: Real-time monitoring of container resource usage, logs, and health status
- **Dev Environments**: Collaborative development environments that can be shared across teams
::

## Docker Desktop Interface

::alert{type="info"}
Docker Desktop provides an intuitive interface for:
1. Managing containers and images: Start, stop, delete, and inspect containers; build, pull, and clean up images
2. Viewing logs and statistics: Real-time container logs, CPU, memory, network, and storage metrics
3. Configuring Docker settings: Resource allocation, file sharing, proxy settings, and advanced features
4. Managing volumes and networks: Create, inspect, and delete persistent volumes and custom networks
5. Running Docker commands: Integrated terminal for command-line operations without leaving the UI
6. Kubernetes operations: Deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications on Kubernetes
7. Extension integration: Access third-party tools and services directly from the Docker Desktop interface
::

```bash
# Command-line equivalents to Docker Desktop UI actions
# List containers (equivalent to Containers tab)
docker ps -a

# View container logs (equivalent to container logs view)
docker logs container_name

# View container stats (equivalent to container stats view)
docker stats container_name
```

## Docker Desktop Settings

::steps
### Resources
```yaml
# Example resource allocation in settings.json
{
  "cpus": 4,                # Number of CPU cores allocated to Docker VM
  "memory": "8 GB",         # RAM allocated to Docker engine
  "swap": "1 GB",           # Additional swap space for memory-intensive operations
  "diskSize": "60 GB",      # Size of the virtual disk for container storage
  "dataFolder": "/path/to/custom/docker-data",  # Custom data location
  "memorySwap": "9 GB",     # Total memory including swap (memory + swap)
  "diskImage": "/path/to/docker-disk.raw" # Custom disk image location
}
```

Resource allocation directly impacts Docker performance:
- Insufficient CPU: Slow container startup and build times
- Limited memory: Container crashes with out-of-memory errors
- Small disk size: "No space left on device" errors during builds
- Appropriate resource allocation prevents performance bottlenecks

### File Sharing
- **Configure shared folders**: Specify which host directories are available to containers
  ```bash
  # In settings.json or through the UI
  "filesharingDirectories": [
    "/Users/username/projects",
    "/Volumes/data"
  ]
  ```
- **Access host files from containers**: Mount host directories as volumes in containers
  ```bash
  docker run -v /Users/username/projects:/app myimage
  ```
- **Performance considerations**: Different performance characteristics across platforms
  - Windows/WSL2: Best performance in WSL2 filesystem
  - macOS: Slower performance due to osxfs with gRPC FUSE for file sharing
  - Linux: Near-native performance with minimal overhead
- **Filesystem isolation**: Control which directories are accessible to containers for security
  - Selective sharing prevents exposing sensitive host files
  - Use bind mounts for development, named volumes for production
  - Consider using delegated/cached mount options on macOS for performance

### Network
- **Port forwarding**: Expose container services to host network
  ```bash
  # Automatically forward ports or configure in docker-compose.yml
  docker run -p 8080:80 nginx  # Maps container port 80 to host port 8080
  ```
- **DNS configuration**: Configure custom DNS servers for container resolution
  ```json
  {
    "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"],
    "dns-search": ["example.com"]
  }
  ```
- **Proxy settings**: Configure HTTP/HTTPS proxies for container internet access
  ```json
  {
    "httpProxy": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
    "httpsProxy": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
    "noProxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com"
  }
  ```
- **Network driver selection**: Choose appropriate network drivers for different use cases
  - bridge: Default isolated network for containers (default)
  - host: Use host network directly (higher performance, lower isolation)
  - overlay: Multi-host networking for Swarm/Kubernetes
  - macvlan: Assign MAC addresses to containers for physical network appearance
  - none: Disable networking for maximum isolation
::

## Docker Desktop Extensions

```bash
# Install extensions via Docker Desktop UI or CLI
docker extension install name-of-extension

# List installed extensions
docker extension ls

# Update an extension
docker extension update name-of-extension
```

## Docker Dev Environments

::alert{type="warning"}
Docker Dev Environments enable you to:
1. **Share development environments with teammates**: Create reproducible development environments that can be distributed as code
   ```bash
   # Export a development environment
   docker dev-environments export myproject > myproject.devenv
   # Share with teammates who can import it
   docker dev-environments import myproject.devenv
   ```
2. **Create environments from Git repositories**: Spin up ready-to-code environments directly from source control
   ```bash
   # Create from a Git repository
   docker dev-environments create --repo https://github.com/username/project.git
   ```
3. **Maintain consistent tooling across teams**: Eliminate "works on my machine" problems with identical development setups
   ```dockerfile
   # .docker/Dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:16
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y specific-tool=1.2.3
   ```
4. **Isolate project dependencies**: Keep projects separate to prevent dependency conflicts
   ```yaml
   # Each project has isolated containers, volumes, and networks
   volumes:
     node_modules:  # Project-specific dependencies stay with the environment
   ```
5. **Switch between projects quickly**: Toggle between different development environments without reconfiguring tools
   ```bash
   # List available environments
   docker dev-environments ls
   # Start a specific environment
   docker dev-environments open my-project
   ```
6. **Code from any device**: Access the same development environment from different machines with cloud-backed environments
::

## Creating Dev Environments

::steps
### From Git Repository
1. **Click "Create" in Dev Environments**: Access the creation wizard from Docker Desktop
2. **Provide Git repository URL**: Enter a Git repository that contains Docker configuration
   ```
   https://github.com/username/project.git
   ```
3. **Configure environment settings**: Set resource limits, volume mounts, and environment variables
   ```yaml
   # Customizable settings for the environment
   resources:
     cpus: 2
     memory: 4GB
   volumeMounts:
     - source: ~/.ssh
       target: /home/user/.ssh
       readonly: true
   ```
4. **Start the environment**: Docker pulls the repository and builds the development container
   ```bash
   # Behind the scenes, Docker runs:
   git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```
5. **Connect via VS Code or other IDE**: Open the code in your preferred editor with container integration
   ```bash
   # For VS Code
   code --folder-uri vscode-remote://attached-container+name=project_dev
   # Or use the "Open in VS Code" button in Docker Desktop
   ```

### From Local Folder
1. **Select "Create From Local Folder"**: Use existing code on your machine
2. **Choose project directory**: Select the folder containing your code
   ```bash
   # Docker Desktop mounts this directory into the dev environment
   /Users/username/projects/my-application
   ```
3. **Configure Docker Compose settings**: Customize how the environment is built
   ```yaml
   # Docker Desktop generates or uses existing docker-compose.yml
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       volumes:
         - .:/app
         - ~/.aws:/home/user/.aws:ro
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=development
   ```
4. **Launch the environment**: Docker builds and starts the development container
   ```bash
   # Docker performs these operations:
   docker-compose build  # Build any custom images
   docker-compose up -d  # Start the environment
   ```
5. **Start development**: Begin coding with host-container file synchronization
   ```bash
   # Changes in your local directory immediately reflect in the container
   # Example workflow:
   vim src/app.js  # Edit a file locally
   docker-compose exec app npm test  # Run tests in the container
   ```
::

## docker-compose.yaml for Dev Environments

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Configuring Development Containers

::steps
### Dockerfile for Development
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /app

# Install development dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Keep container running
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### VS Code Integration
```json
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "Node.js Development",
  "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yaml",
  "service": "app",
  "workspaceFolder": "/app",
  "extensions": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
  }
}
```
::

## Sharing Dev Environments

```bash
# Export environment settings
docker dev-environments export my-project > my-project.tar.gz

# Share environment with team
# (Via Docker Hub or file sharing)

# Import shared environment
docker dev-environments import my-project.tar.gz
```

## Multi-Container Development

::alert{type="info"}
Best practices for multi-container development:
1. **Define service dependencies in docker-compose.yaml**: Create a complete development stack
   ```yaml
   # Comprehensive docker-compose.yaml with dependencies
   services:
     app:
       build: ./app
       depends_on:
         - db
         - redis
         - elasticsearch
     
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       volumes:
         - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword
     
     redis:
       image: redis:6-alpine
       volumes:
         - redis_data:/data
     
     elasticsearch:
       image: elasticsearch:7.14.0
       environment:
         - discovery.type=single-node
         - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for configuration**: Make environments flexible and portable
   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.yaml
   services:
     app:
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:devpassword@db:5432/myapp
         - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
         - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development}
         - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-app:*}
       env_file:
         - .env.development
   ```

3. **Set up shared volumes for code changes**: Enable real-time code editing
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     # Source code: changes reflect immediately
     - ./src:/app/src
     # Named volume for dependencies: preserves installation between restarts
     - node_modules:/app/node_modules
     # Cache build artifacts
     - build-cache:/app/.cache
   ```

4. **Configure network aliases for service discovery**: Simplify container-to-container communication
   ```yaml
   services:
     api:
       networks:
         backend:
           aliases:
             - api.internal
     
     web:
       networks:
         frontend:
         backend:
       depends_on:
         - api
   
   networks:
     frontend:
     backend:
       internal: true  # Not exposed outside Docker
   ```

5. **Implement hot-reloading for rapid development**: Instant feedback for code changes
   ```yaml
   # For Node.js applications
   command: npm run dev  # Uses nodemon or similar tool
   
   # For React applications
   environment:
     - FAST_REFRESH=true
     - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true  # For some filesystems
   ```

6. **Set up debugging capabilities**: Connect debuggers from your IDE to running containers
   ```yaml
   # For Node.js applications
   command: node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 app.js
   ports:
     - "9229:9229"  # Expose debug port
   ```
::

## Volume Mounts and Performance

::steps
### Bind Mounts
- **Real-time code updates**: Changes to source code are immediately visible inside containers
  ```bash
  # Edit code on host, container sees changes instantly
  docker run -v $(pwd)/src:/app/src node:16 npm run dev
  ```
- **Native filesystem access**: Container processes can read/write host files directly
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./src:/app/src  # Direct mapping of source directory
    - ./config:/app/config:ro  # Read-only access to configuration
  ```
- **Development workflow integration**: Works with IDEs, linters, and other developer tools
  ```yaml
  # VSCode can access files while container runs the code
  volumes:
    - .:/app  # Mount entire project for IDE integration
  ```
- **Performance considerations per OS**:
  - Windows with WSL2: Near-native performance when files are in WSL2 filesystem
  - Windows with Hyper-V: Slower performance due to filesystem translation
  - macOS: Performance penalties of 10-20x for I/O-intensive operations
  - Linux: Best performance with minimal overhead
  ```yaml
  # macOS performance optimizations
  volumes:
    - ./src:/app/src:delegated  # Improves performance by delaying host updates
  ```
- **Path mapping configuration**: Configure exact mapping between host and container paths
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    # Absolute paths
    - /Users/developer/projects/myapp:/app
    # Relative paths (relative to docker-compose.yml)
    - ./logs:/app/logs
    # Home directory references
    - ~/configs:/app/configs
  ```

### Volume Types
```bash
# Named volume (for dependencies and build artifacts)
docker run -v my_node_modules:/app/node_modules -v .:/app node:16

# Bind mount (for source code)
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:16 npm run dev
```
::

## Debugging in Docker Development Environments

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml with debugging configuration
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "9229:9229"  # Node.js debug port
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    command: npm run debug  # Script with --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229
```

- Configure resource limits
- Use buildkit for faster builds

### Team Workflows
- Document environment setup
- Use version control for Docker files
- Implement container health checks
- Create development-specific documentation
- Standardize port allocations
::

## Troubleshooting

::alert{type="info"}
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Resource constraints**: Adjust Docker Desktop resource allocation
   ```json
   // Settings.json
   {
     "cpus": 6,           // Increase from default
     "memory": "8GB",     // Increase for memory-intensive applications
     "memorySwap": "2GB"  // Add swap space
   }
   ```
   - Symptom: Slow container performance, out-of-memory errors
   - Diagnosis: Check Docker Desktop dashboard for resource usage spikes
   - Solution: Increase allocated resources in Docker Desktop settings

2. **Volume mount issues**: Check file permissions and paths
   ```bash
   # Check permissions on host directory
   ls -la /path/to/mounted/directory
   
   # Verify mount inside container
   docker exec -it container_name ls -la /container/mount/point
   
   # Fix permission issues
   sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /path/to/mounted/directory
   ```
   - Symptom: "Permission denied" errors, missing files in container
   - Diagnosis: Compare permissions between host and container paths
   - Solution: Adjust permissions, use named volumes, or add user mapping

3. **Network connectivity**: Verify port mappings and network settings
   ```bash
   # Check port bindings
   docker port container_name
   
   # Test network connectivity from host
   curl localhost:mapped_port
   
   # Test network connectivity between containers
   docker exec -it container_name ping other_container
   ```
   - Symptom: "Connection refused" errors, services unreachable
   - Diagnosis: Check container networks and port bindings
   - Solution: Verify port mappings, check for port conflicts, inspect container networks

4. **Performance problems**: Optimize volume mounts and consider caching
   ```yaml
   # For macOS/Windows, use delegated/cached mounts
   volumes:
     - ./src:/app/src:delegated
   
   # Use named volumes for dependency directories
   volumes:
     - node_modules:/app/node_modules
     - vendor:/app/vendor
   
   # Use tmpfs for temporary files
   tmpfs:
     - /app/tmp
   ```
   - Symptom: Slow container startup, sluggish file operations
   - Diagnosis: Monitor I/O performance in container
   - Solution: Use volume mount optimizations, move to named volumes for dependencies

5. **Extension conflicts**: Update or reinstall problematic extensions
   ```bash
   # List installed extensions
   docker extension ls
   
   # Remove problematic extension
   docker extension rm extension_name
   
   # Update extension
   docker extension update extension_name
   ```
   - Symptom: Docker Desktop crashes or freezes when using certain features
   - Diagnosis: Test with extensions disabled
   - Solution: Update, reinstall, or remove problematic extensions

6. **Kernel compatibility**: Update Docker Desktop to latest version
   ```bash
   # Check Docker version
   docker version
   
   # Update Docker Desktop through the UI or download latest version
   ```
   - Symptom: Container startup failures, kernel-related errors
   - Diagnosis: Check Docker Desktop logs for kernel-related messages
   - Solution: Update Docker Desktop, ensure WSL2 is up to date (Windows), or update Linux kernel

7. **Dev Environments not starting**: Check configuration and settings
   ```bash
   # View environment logs
   docker dev-environments logs environment_name
   
   # Reset environment
   docker dev-environments rm environment_name
   docker dev-environments create --repo repo_url
   ```
   - Symptom: Environment creation fails or gets stuck
   - Diagnosis: Check logs and repository configuration
   - Solution: Verify repository has proper Docker configuration, check resource availability

## Advanced Docker Desktop Features

::steps
### Kubernetes Integration
- **Enable Kubernetes in settings**: Activate built-in Kubernetes cluster
  ```yaml
  # In settings.json or through the UI
  {
    "kubernetes": {
      "enabled": true,
      "showSystemContainers": false
    }
  }
  ```
- **Deploy to local cluster**: Test Kubernetes deployments locally before production
  ```bash
  # Deploy application to local Kubernetes
  kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
  
  # Monitor pods
  kubectl get pods -w
  
  # Access services (automatically configured in Docker Desktop)
  curl localhost:8080
  ```
- **Use kubectl through Docker Desktop**: Integrated kubectl without separate installation
  ```bash
  # Docker Desktop sets up the kubectl context automatically
  kubectl config current-context
  # docker-desktop
  
  # All standard kubectl commands work
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get namespaces
  kubectl describe deployment my-app
  ```
- **Dashboard integration**: Access Kubernetes resources through Docker Desktop UI
  ```
  # The Kubernetes tab shows:
  - Deployments
  - Pods
  - Services
  - ConfigMaps
  - Secrets
  - Logs and events
  ```
- **Context switching**: Easily switch between different Kubernetes clusters
  ```bash
  # Switch context
  kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
  
  # View available contexts
  kubectl config get-contexts
  
  # Docker Desktop updates its UI based on current context
  ```
- **Resource management**: Allocate appropriate resources to Kubernetes
  ```json
  // Settings.json
  {
    "kubernetes": {
      "cpus": 2,
      "memory": "4GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
  ```

### WSL 2 Integration (Windows)
- **Improved performance**: Dramatically faster than legacy Hyper-V backend
  ```powershell
  # WSL 2 backend offers near-native Linux performance
  # Build performance comparison example:
  # Legacy: docker build . -t myapp  # ~120 seconds
  # WSL 2:  docker build . -t myapp  # ~45 seconds
  ```
- **Linux container support**: Run Linux containers natively without emulation
  ```bash
  # WSL 2 runs a real Linux kernel
  docker exec -it mycontainer uname -a
  # Linux containerhost 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP...
  ```
- **File system access**: Superior performance when files are in WSL 2 filesystem
  ```bash
  # Best performance with projects in WSL filesystem
  # In WSL terminal:
  cd ~/projects/myapp
  docker run -v $(pwd):/app node:16 npm run build  # Fast I/O
  
  # Windows path mounting is still supported but slower
  docker run -v /c/Users/username/projects/myapp:/app node:16 npm run build
  ```
- **Resource sharing**: Efficient memory sharing between host and Docker
  ```yaml
  # In .wslconfig
  [wsl2]
  memory=8GB
  processors=4
  swap=2GB
  # Docker automatically uses these resources
  ```
- **Terminal integration**: Seamless command-line experience
  ```bash
  # Launch WSL terminal directly from Docker Desktop
  # Or use from Windows Terminal, with Docker context already set up
  
  # Run Docker commands directly in WSL
  wsl docker ps
  wsl docker-compose up -d
  
  # Use VSCode with WSL and Docker integration
  code --remote wsl
  ```
- **Distribution options**: Choice of WSL distros for Docker backend
  ```json
  // Settings.json
  {
    "wslEngineEnabled": true,
    "wslDistro": "Ubuntu-20.04"  // Choose specific distribution
  }
  ```
