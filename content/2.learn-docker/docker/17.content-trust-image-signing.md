## Docker Content Trust and Image Signing

Docker Content Trust (DCT) provides a way to verify the integrity and publisher of container images, enabling secure software supply chains and ensuring that only trusted content runs in your environment. It implements a signing system that allows users to cryptographically verify the authenticity of images before pulling or running them, which is crucial for security-sensitive applications and environments.

DCT creates a chain of trust from image publishers to consumers, ensuring images haven't been tampered with at any point in the distribution process. This mechanism addresses critical security challenges in container deployments by preventing unauthorized or modified container images from running in your infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

::steps
### Docker Content Trust
- Verifies image integrity through cryptographic hashing of all layers
- Validates image publisher identity using digital signatures
- Prevents running tampered images by rejecting unsigned or invalidly signed content
- Integrates with Docker CLI through native commands and environment variables
- Provides chain of trust from publisher to runtime environment
- Enables non-repudiation of image publishing actions
- Secures the entire software supply chain from build to deployment

### Signing System
- Uses Notary project, an open-source implementation of a signing system
- Implements The Update Framework (TUF), a security specification for secure content distribution
- Manages root keys (highest authority, kept offline) and delegation keys (day-to-day signing)
- Establishes offline root of trust to minimize exposure of critical keys
- Maintains online repository metadata for signature verification
- Creates hierarchical trust relationships for flexible signing workflows
- Includes timestamp services to prevent replay attacks
::

## Enabling Content Trust

::alert{type="info"}
Docker Content Trust can be enabled globally with an environment variable or per-command with a flag. When enabled, Docker automatically verifies signatures when pulling images and signs images when pushing:

```bash
# Enable globally for all Docker commands in current shell session
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

# Use per command to enable for a specific operation
docker pull --disable-content-trust=false nginx:latest

# Use per command to disable for a specific operation when globally enabled
docker pull --disable-content-trust=true nginx:latest

# Check if Docker Content Trust is enabled
echo $DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST
```

Enabling DCT will require signature verification for all image operations. With DCT enabled, Docker will refuse to pull or run images that aren't properly signed by their publishers or have been tampered with after signing.
::

## Key Management

```bash
# Generate and load keys (done automatically on first push with DCT enabled)
docker trust key generate my-signing-key
# This creates a new signing key pair and stores them in your local Docker trust store
# The private key is protected with a passphrase you'll need to provide
# The public key is used for verification and can be shared

# Add a signer to a repository
docker trust signer add --key my-signing-key.pub alice myorg/myimage
# This adds a new authorized signer (alice) to the repository
# Only designated signers can create valid signatures for the repository
# Enables delegation of signing authority to multiple team members
# Requires repository admin permissions

# Remove a signer
docker trust signer remove alice myorg/myimage
# Revokes signing privileges for the specified user
# Previously signed images remain valid
# Future signatures from this signer will be rejected
# Useful when team members leave or responsibilities change

# View signing keys
docker trust key ls
# Lists all signing keys available to the current user
# Shows key IDs, types, and locations
# Helps manage your signing infrastructure
# Does not display private key material

# Rotate keys
docker trust key rotate myorg/myimage
# Updates the signing keys for a repository
# Critical for security after potential compromise
# Establishes new trust chain while maintaining image access
# Should be part of regular security maintenance
```

Docker creates two types of keys when you first enable DCT:
- Root key: Your most valuable key that should be kept offline and secure
- Repository key: Generated for each repository you push to, used for day-to-day signing

## Signing Images

::steps
### Basic Image Signing
```bash
# With DCT enabled, signing happens automatically on push
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker push myorg/myimage:latest
# Docker will prompt for your signing key passphrase
# Image layers and manifest are cryptographically signed
# Signatures are stored in the Notary server (often co-located with registry)
# The signed content can now be verified by consumers

# Explicitly sign an image that was previously pushed
docker trust sign myorg/myimage:latest
# Signs an existing image without pushing it again
# Useful for retroactively signing images
# Adds your signature to the trust metadata
# Requires the image to already exist in the registry
```

### Viewing Signature Information
```bash
# Inspect trust data for an image
docker trust inspect myorg/myimage:latest
# Shows signers, roles, and signature metadata
# Displays signing timestamps and expiration dates
# Lists key IDs used for signing
# JSON format output for programmatic processing

# Inspect with expanded certificates and human-readable format
docker trust inspect --pretty myorg/myimage:latest
# Provides a more readable output format with formatted dates
# Shows detailed certificate information
# Displays hierarchical trust relationships
# Better for human analysis and troubleshooting
```

When Docker trust is enabled, every image pull operation will verify the signatures against the Notary server before allowing the image to be used, providing continuous protection against image tampering.

## Automating Image Signing

::alert{type="warning"}
For CI/CD pipelines, you need to securely manage signing keys with specialized security measures:
1. Store keys in secure vaults
   - Use services like HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, or Azure Key Vault
   - Never store private keys in source code or unsecured CI variables
   - Implement access controls with least privilege principles
   - Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for critical keys

2. Use delegation roles for automated signing
   - Create CI-specific signing identities with limited scope
   - Implement role-based access control for signing operations
   - Separate development, testing, and production signing authorities
   - Use different keys for different stages of your pipeline

3. Implement proper key rotation policies
   - Schedule regular key rotations (e.g., quarterly)
   - Automate the rotation process to minimize human error
   - Maintain a secure backup of previous keys during transition
   - Document clear procedures for emergency key rotations

4. Consider threshold signing for critical images
   - Require multiple signers for production images (m-of-n signing)
   - Implement approval workflows before signature application
   - Separate duties between build and signing operations
   - Create security gates between build and deployment

5. Audit signature events
   - Log all signing operations with detailed metadata
   - Monitor for unusual signing patterns or unauthorized attempts
   - Create alerts for signature verification failures
   - Maintain immutable audit trails for compliance purposes
   - Regularly review signing activity for security governance

          docker push myorg/myimage:${{ github.sha }}
          docker push myorg/myimage:latest
```

## Notary Architecture

::steps
### Notary Components
- Notary Server: Stores and serves signed metadata for repositories

::

## Advanced Signing with Notary

```bash
# Initialize a Notary repository
notary init example.com/myorg/myimage
# Creates a new trusted collection for your image
# Generates initial root, targets, snapshot, and timestamp metadata
# Establishes trust hierarchy for the repository
# You'll need to provide a passphrase for the root and repository keys

# Add a delegation key
notary delegation add example.com/myorg/myimage targets/releases alice.crt --all-paths
# Creates a delegation role called "releases" under the targets role
# Adds Alice's certificate as an authorized signer for this delegation
# The --all-paths flag allows signing any path in the repository
# For more granular control, specify paths like "path:v1*" instead

# Publish changes
notary publish example.com/myorg/myimage
# Uploads the locally modified trust metadata to the Notary server
# Makes your changes visible to other users of the repository
# Updates the snapshot and timestamp metadata with current state
# Requires authentication to the Notary server

# List keys in Notary
notary key list
# Shows all keys in your local Notary trust store
# Displays key IDs, locations, roles, and key types
# Helps inventory your signing capabilities
# Does not show private key material or passphrases

# Rotate a key
notary key rotate example.com/myorg/myimage targets/releases
# Replaces the existing key with a new one for the specified role
# Maintains trust chain during key transition
# Critical for security after suspected compromise
# Updates delegation metadata to use new key
# All previously signed content remains valid
```

The Notary CLI provides a more direct and granular interface to the trust system than the Docker trust commands, making it valuable for advanced trust management scenarios and automation.

## Cosign Integration

::alert{type="info"}
Cosign is a modern alternative to Docker Content Trust that offers additional features as part of the Sigstore project. It provides simpler tooling, keyless signing options, and better integration with cloud-native ecosystems:

```bash
# Install Cosign
brew install cosign
# Also available via other package managers:
# apt-get install cosign
# npm install -g cosign
# Available as a container: docker run gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign

# Generate keys
cosign generate-key-pair
# Creates a public/private key pair for signing
# Private key (cosign.key) is protected with a password
# Public key (cosign.pub) is used for verification
# Keys use modern ECDSA cryptography (P-256 curve)

# Sign an image
cosign sign --key cosign.key myorg/myimage:latest
# Signs the image and stores signature in the registry alongside the image
# No separate Notary server required
# Signature is stored as an OCI artifact in the same registry
# Supports both OCI and Docker registries

# Verify an image
cosign verify --key cosign.pub myorg/myimage:latest
# Retrieves and verifies the signature for the specified image
# Shows signature details and verification status
# Outputs the signing certificate and timestamp
# Provides non-repudiation for signed images

# Keyless signing with OIDC identity
cosign sign --identity-token=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token) myorg/myimage:latest
# Uses your authenticated identity instead of a key file
# Leverages OIDC providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
# Signatures can be traced back to authenticated users
# Simplifies key management by eliminating private keys
```

Cosign integrates with other Sigstore projects like Fulcio (certificate authority) and Rekor (transparency log) to provide a complete trust ecosystem with enhanced security and auditability.
