## Managing Docker Plugins

::alert{type="info"}
Docker plugins can be installed, enabled, disabled, and removed using the Docker CLI, providing a straightforward way to manage the plugin lifecycle:

```bash
# Install a plugin
docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki
# Downloads and installs the Loki logging driver plugin
# --alias flag creates a shorter name for easier reference
# Plugin is installed in a disabled state by default
# Will prompt for required plugin permissions
# Can accept plugin-specific configuration with --grant-all-permissions

# List installed plugins
docker plugin ls
# Shows all installed plugins with their version and status
# Displays whether plugins are enabled or disabled
# Shows plugin type and ID information
# Lists any applied alias names
# Example output shows version, enabled status, and settings

# Inspect plugin details
docker plugin inspect grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest
# Shows detailed configuration and metadata
# Displays plugin API version and interface types
# Lists all plugin settings and their current values
# Shows capabilities and permissions required
# Includes detailed socket and runtime information

# Disable a plugin
docker plugin disable grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest
# Gracefully stops the plugin without removing it
# Releases resources used by the plugin
# Any containers using the plugin must be stopped first
# Plugin remains installed but inactive
# Use --force to disable even with dependent containers (dangerous)

# Enable a plugin
docker plugin enable grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest
# Activates a previously installed or disabled plugin
# Initializes plugin resources and connections
# Makes the plugin available for immediate use
# Plugin starts listening on its defined socket
# Services depending on the plugin can now use it

# Remove a plugin
docker plugin rm grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest
# Completely removes the plugin from the system
# Plugin must be disabled before removal
# Deletes all plugin-related files and configurations
# Cannot be undone - reinstallation is required to restore
# Use --force to remove even if enabled (not recommended)
```
::

## Volume Plugins

```yaml
# Example docker-compose.yml with volume plugin
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13

      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  postgres_data:
    driver: rexray/ebs  # Amazon EBS volume plugin
    driver_opts:
      size: "20"        # 20GB volume size
      volumetype: "gp2" # General Purpose SSD
      iops: "3000"      # Provisioned IOPS
      encrypted: "true" # Enable encryption
      availability: "us-east-1a" # Specific availability zone
      # Supports automatic mounting across container restarts
      # Enables consistent storage across host changes

## Developing Custom Plugins

::alert{type="warning"}
Plugin development requires understanding Docker's plugin architecture and following a structured development approach:
1. Implement the appropriate plugin API
   - Study the specific interface requirements for your plugin type
   - Implement all required methods and callbacks
   - Follow best practices for error handling and resource management
   - Consider performance implications, especially for data path plugins
   - Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations
   - Example: Volume plugins must implement Create, Mount, Unmount, etc.

2. Package the plugin for distribution
   - Create a config.json describing plugin capabilities and requirements
   - Define required host capabilities and permissions
   - Structure plugin rootfs following OCI specifications
   - Set up proper socket configuration for daemon communication
   - Include appropriate metadata for plugin discovery
   - Example: Docker plugin package structure with rootfs/ and config.json

3. Test thoroughly under various conditions
   - Verify functionality across different Docker versions
   - Test under heavy load and error conditions
   - Validate behavior during Docker daemon restart
   - Ensure proper cleanup on plugin disable/enable cycles
   - Simulate network partitions and resource constraints
   - Example: Automated test suite covering normal operations and edge cases

4. Handle upgrade paths and versioning
   - Implement backward compatibility where possible
   - Design state migration between versions
   - Document breaking changes clearly
   - Provide tooling for configuration updates
   - Follow semantic versioning principles
   - Example: Version upgrade procedure with state preservation

5. Document configuration options and requirements
   - Detail all configuration parameters with examples
   - Specify environment requirements and prerequisites
   - Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Include performance tuning recommendations
   - Create quickstart guides for new users
   - Example: Comprehensive documentation with real-world use cases

## Authorization Plugins

::steps
### Authentication Flow
- Request interception
  - Plugin receives API request before processing
  - Complete request context is provided
  - Headers, body, and user information included
  - Plugin can examine the entire request
  - Synchronous processing blocks the request until complete
  
- Policy evaluation
  - Apply custom authorization rules
  - Check against external policy systems
  - Evaluate user permissions and roles
  - Consider request context (time, source IP, etc.)
  - Implement advanced logic like quotas or rate limits
  
- Request authorization
  - Determine whether to allow or deny
  - Provide reason for authorization decisions
  - Optionally modify request content
  - Implement conditional authorization logic
  - Support for request transformation
  
- Response handling
  - Optionally process the API response
  - Filter or modify response content
  - Apply post-processing security controls
  - Verify response integrity
  - Implement data loss prevention
  
- Audit logging
  - Record all authorization decisions
  - Capture complete request context
  - Log to external systems for compliance
  - Include timing and performance data
  - Support for forensic analysis
