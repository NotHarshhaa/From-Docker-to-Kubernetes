## Service Mesh

A service mesh provides an infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication with additional capabilities like traffic management, security, and observability. Unlike traditional networking approaches, a service mesh decouples the application logic from the network communication logic by implementing a dedicated infrastructure layer.

Service meshes solve complex microservices challenges by providing:
- Uniform network observability across services
- Consistent security policies with mutual TLS (mTLS)
- Intelligent traffic management without code changes
- Built-in resilience patterns like circuit breaking and retries

## Service Mesh Components

::steps
### Control Plane
- **Configuration management**: Centralized configuration for all mesh policies
- **Policy enforcement**: Implementing security, traffic, and access policies
- **Certificate management**: Handling TLS certificates for secure communication
- **API integration**: Exposing APIs for mesh configuration and monitoring
- **Service discovery**: Maintaining a registry of available services and endpoints

### Data Plane
- **Proxies (sidecars)**: Lightweight network proxies (like Envoy) deployed alongside each service
- **Traffic routing**: Dynamic request routing based on various attributes like headers, paths
- **Load balancing**: Advanced load balancing with support for various algorithms and health checking
- **Circuit breaking**: Preventing cascading failures by detecting and isolating failing services
- **Telemetry collection**: Gathering detailed metrics, logs, and traces for each request
::

The control plane and data plane work together in a complementary fashion:
1. The control plane defines policies and configurations
2. These configurations are distributed to all sidecar proxies
3. The data plane sidecars enforce these policies for every request
4. Telemetry data flows back to the control plane for monitoring and analysis

## Istio Example

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```

## Traffic Management

::alert{type="info"}
Service mesh enables advanced traffic patterns:
1. **Canary deployments**: Gradually shifting traffic to new versions (e.g., 5%, 20%, 50%, 100%)
2. **A/B testing**: Routing different users to different versions based on criteria like user ID, region, or headers
3. **Blue/green deployments**: Maintaining two identical environments and switching traffic instantly
4. **Circuit breaking**: Automatically stopping traffic to failing services to prevent cascading failures
5. **Fault injection**: Deliberately introducing errors to test application resilience
6. **Traffic mirroring**: Sending a copy of live traffic to a test service for validation without affecting users
7. **Weighted routing**: Distributing traffic across multiple service versions with precise percentage control
8. **Retry policies**: Automatically retrying failed requests with configurable backoff strategies
9. **Timeout management**: Setting request timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
::

These traffic management capabilities allow teams to:
- Deploy new versions with minimal risk
- Test in production safely
- Build resilient applications
- Troubleshoot complex issues
- Optimize user experience

## Ingress Controllers

Ingress controllers expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. They serve as the entry point for external traffic and provide essential capabilities for managing that traffic.

Unlike basic Kubernetes Services of type LoadBalancer or NodePort, Ingress controllers offer:
- Path-based routing to different backend services
- Host-based virtual hosting for multiple domains
- TLS/SSL termination
- URL rewriting and redirection
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and traffic control

In the Kubernetes architecture, an Ingress controller consists of:
1. A reverse proxy implementation (NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik, etc.)
2. Controller logic that watches Kubernetes API for Ingress resources
3. Additional configuration for the specific proxy being used

## Ingress Resource

The Ingress resource is a Kubernetes API object that defines how external HTTP/HTTPS traffic should be routed to services within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    # Controller-specific configuration
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
spec:
  # Specifies which Ingress controller to use
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  # First rule: Routes for example.com
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app
        pathType: Prefix    # Other options: Exact, ImplementationSpecific
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-service
            port:
              number: 80
  # Second rule: Routes for api.example.com
  - host: api.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 8080
```

Key components of the Ingress resource:
- **metadata.annotations**: Controller-specific configuration options
- **spec.ingressClassName**: Specifies which Ingress controller implementation to use
- **spec.rules**: List of host and path rules for routing
- **spec.rules[].host**: Domain name for virtual hosting
- **spec.rules[].http.paths**: List of URL paths and their backend services
- **pathType**: How to match the path (Prefix, Exact, ImplementationSpecific)

## Troubleshooting

::steps
### Service Mesh Issues
- **Sidecar injection failures**:
  ```bash
  # Check if automatic injection is enabled
  kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
  
  # Verify pod has sidecar injected
  kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'
  ```
- **mTLS configuration problems**:
  ```bash
  # Verify mTLS policy
  kubectl get peerauthentication -A
  
  # Test connection between services
  istioctl x describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
- **Routing misconfiguration**:
  ```bash
  # Validate virtual service
  istioctl analyze virtualservice/<name>
  
  # Check if routes are applied
  istioctl proxy-config routes <pod-name>.<namespace>
  ```
- **Control plane connectivity**:
  ```bash
  # Check control plane pods
  kubectl get pods -n istio-system
  
  # Verify istiod connectivity
  istioctl proxy-status
  ```
- **Telemetry collection issues**:
  ```bash
  # Check if Prometheus is scraping metrics
  kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/prometheus 9090:9090
  # Then open http://localhost:9090 in browser
  
  # Verify traces are being collected
  kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/jaeger 16686:16686
  # Then open http://localhost:16686 in browser
  ```

### Ingress Issues
- **Certificate problems**:
  ```bash
  # Check TLS secret
  kubectl get secret <tls-secret-name> -o yaml
  
  # Verify certificate is valid
  kubectl get secret <tls-secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -text -noout
  ```
- **Routing errors**:
  ```bash
  # Validate Ingress resource
  kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>
  
  # Check Ingress controller logs
  kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx deploy/ingress-nginx-controller
  ```
- **Backend connectivity**:
  ```bash
  # Test service connectivity from inside cluster
  kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=curlimages/curl -- curl http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>
  
  # Check endpoints for service
  kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
  ```
- **Configuration validation**:
  ```bash
  # Verify Ingress configuration
  kubectl get ingress <ingress-name> -o yaml
  
  # Check for controller-specific issues
  kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=Ingress
  ```
- **Resource constraints**:
  ```bash
  # Check resource usage
  kubectl top pods -n ingress-nginx
  
  # Verify resource requests and limits
  kubectl describe deploy -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller
  ```
::

Common debugging techniques:
1. Enable debug logging in Ingress controllers or mesh components
2. Use port-forwarding to access internal dashboards and UIs
3. Deploy test pods to verify network connectivity from inside the cluster
4. Check controller-specific documentation for troubleshooting guides
5. Review Kubernetes events for clues about failures
